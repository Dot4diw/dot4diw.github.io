## Introduction
The core function of the software is implemented based on [ImageMagick's Magick++](https://imagemagick.org/script/magick++.php), and the graphical interface is based on the [MFC framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/mfc/framework-mfc?view=msvc-170). Its main function is to achieve high-quality conversion between PDF to image and image formats.

#### This is an impromptu rough little program, the code is badly written, and the functions can only be used as needed.
